Alison McCondichie - Homework 5 - Data Visualization Challenge

The objective of this notebook is to exam data from a study ran on mice with tumors treated with a variety of drug regimens and create visualizations of the results to easily draw conclusions of drug regimen success. Some data cleaning and statistical functions were required to filter and create information that was helpful for our conclusions.

One important conclusion drawn from the data is that Capomulin and Ramicane are the two most success drugs in this treatment study. We can see this from the bar chart showing amount of timepoints per drug regimen. More timepoints means mice lasted longer, mice that lasted the longest through the study were treated with those two drugs.

Another evident conclusion is that there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. You can visualize this really well in the final scatter plot in this notebook that includes a regression line. As mouse weight increases, tumor volume consistently increases as well.
